	<p>This is an example of Nested UI Routing in SAPUI5!</p>
	
	<p>I've changed the Router and Route components of SAPUI5 and made it possible to change multiple parts(views) of a page while routing instead of replacing whole the page. 
	This has the advantage to have only one masterpage with your css. 
	When navigating to the next page will only replace specific parts of the page and not the whole page.</p>
	
	<p>It's comparable to the AngularJS UI-router <a href="https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/wiki">https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/wiki</a> </p>
